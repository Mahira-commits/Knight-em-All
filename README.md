# Whack-A-Mole

**Virtual and Augmented Reality Project**

The game is a spin-off of the typical arcade game Whack-A-Mole. The game setting will follow medieval aesthetics, and it will take place in an old kingdom with green scenery. The goal of the game is to hit the goblins and dragon characters as they appear while avoiding hitting the princess character. Each level will have a time limit and a score goal that the player must achieve to move on to the next level of the game. The levels will differ in the number of moles appearing at once and the time limit. If the player hits the princess more than three times or the timer runs out before achieving the score, the game is immediately over. Different characters award the player different points based on their rarity. In addition, the player can accumulate a combo to add a multiplier to the points rewarded by not missing hitting any characters in a sequence. If the player misses a character, one point is deducted. The game levels will get progressively more difficult by reducing the amount of time the characters appear from the hole before disappearing and the number of characters appearing at once.
